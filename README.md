# Coupon form text filter #

Provides a text filter that provides an inline coupon entry form.

Use [couponinput] or <couponinput> in your text to render a coupon form using a filter callback.
The former is the preferred way of doing this, but if you wish to hide the filter shortform identifier, the latter can be used.
